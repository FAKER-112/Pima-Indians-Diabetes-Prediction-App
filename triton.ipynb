    "Absolutely — if your goal is to build a **full Triton-based GPU layer library**, you want layers where **memory access patterns dominate performance**, or where **fusing operations can reduce trips to memory**. Here’s a structured list:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1️⃣ Element-wise / simple arithmetic layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide** — useful to fuse `(A+B)*C` style ops\n",
    "* **ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU, Sigmoid, Tanh** — nonlinear activations\n",
    "* **LayerNorm, BatchNorm** (forward + backward) — classic for transformers & CNNs\n",
    "* **Dropout** — can fuse with activations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ These are usually “embarrassingly parallel” and easy to implement in Triton.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2️⃣ Reduction-heavy layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Softmax / LogSoftmax** — requires sum/max across one axis; ideal for deterministic accumulation\n",
    "* **Sum / Mean / Variance / Standard Deviation**\n",
    "* **Argmax / Max / Min / Top-K**\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Triton allows **parallel reduction + shared memory tiling**, which is much faster than sequential loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3️⃣ Convolutional / spatial layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1D, 2D, 3D Convolutions** (forward + backward) — huge win when fusing tiling + memory reuse\n",
    "* **Depthwise Convolutions**\n",
    "* **Transpose Convolutions / Deconvolutions**\n",
    "* **MaxPool / AvgPool / Adaptive Pooling** (forward + backward)\n",

    "Triton can **tile input + kernel into shared memory**, compute multiple outputs per thread block, then write back.\n",

    "* **Causal attention / masked attention**\n",

    "💡 These are layers where **fusing multiple small ops** can drastically reduce memory traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy for building a full Triton library**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple:** element-wise, activation, reductions.\n",
    "2. **Move to CNN layers:** conv, pooling, normalization.\n",
    "3. **Transformers / attention:** Q*K*V fusion, softmax, dropout.\n",
    "4. **Linear / MLP blocks:** fuse multiple linear + activation + dropout.\n",
    "5. **Add helpers/utilities:** grid/block tuning, deterministic accumulation, mixed precision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
